# Community Grants Program

The Community Rewards Program allows anyone in the Tezos community to be recognized and rewarded for their efforts. The CRP is managed by [Tezos Commons](https://tezoscommons.org/rewards/). Numerous factors are used when evaluating submissions such as, quality of submissions, quality of activity, number of submissions, and verifiable proof of activity done by the nominee (no single factor is determinative of a winner, as all factors were weighed to select winners). The judges would like to note that for each category, they are looking for the respective monthly related activity meaning submissions should reflect activities done for that current month, i.e.; month of February activities (this applies to all categories except the OG category).

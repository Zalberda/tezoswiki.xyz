# Small Grants Program

The Small Grants Program is a Tezos Commons initiative to bring more development to the Tezos ecosystem through smaller more accessible grants. This program will offer bite sized funding of up to $10,000 USD for low cost, intermittent, and experimental projects that benefit the Tezos ecosystem. The goal of this program is to rapidly prototype the ideas necessary to scale our blockchain and communities for tomorrow.

At this time, The Community Grants program is only available to projects based out of North America (US & Canada)

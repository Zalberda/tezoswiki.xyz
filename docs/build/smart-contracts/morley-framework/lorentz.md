## Lorentz

[Lorentz](https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/master/code/lorentz/README.md) is a stack-based embedded Domain Specific Language \(eDSL\) in Haskell that compiles to Michelson.

Some of its noteworthy features are:

* An expressive type system, including product/sum types and parametric polymorphism.
* Powerful type inference.
* Type-safe mechanisms for writing smart contracts with an upgradeable storage and contract migrations.
* The ability to easily share and reuse components of a contract as Haskell packages.
* The ability to automatically generate documentation for your smart contract in Markdown format,

  and to keep it up-to-date with the contract's code as it evolves.

## Indigo

Indigo eDSL is a high-level language for developing Michelson contracts.

Like [Lorentz](/build/smart-contracts/morley-framework/lorentz), it makes full use of Haskell's type system to ensure safety, expressiveness and reusability.

It is meant first and foremost to free you from the burden of manual stack management required by languages like Michelson and Lorentz, and supports common features of imperative languages, such as mutable variables and _while_ loops.

## LIGO

[LIGO](https://ligolang.org) is a programming language for Tezos with support for different syntaxes:

* CameLIGO, an OCaml inspired syntax
* ReasonLIGO, a functional JavaScript-like syntax inspired by ReasonML
* PascaLIGO, a Pascal inspired syntax

These syntaxes are transformed into an intermediate representation, which is type checked and efficiently translated into Michelson.

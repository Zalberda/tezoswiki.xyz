### Getting started

The wiki is separated into five sections:

* The welcome section includes this page, the white paper and position paper.
* Learn - A general knowledgebase of Tezos for anyone and everyone. 
* Build - Is more for developers, project leaders and those wishing to build and develop on Tezos. 
* User - Contains information and resources for users and those wishing to put Tezos into practice.
* Contribute - Has more resources for assisting with this page. 

To get started with Tezos developer documentation, [see here](http://tezos.gitlab.io/) or the [Tezos.com developer portal](https://tezos.com/developer-portal).
